--------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Auto-Bill Wiki/FAQ!

## What is Auto-Bill?
Auto-Bill is a collection of python and shell scripts using PhantomJS/GhostDriver to automate the download and printing of a Virgin Media electronic bill.

### Pre-requisites

* Python 2.7.2
* Selenium 2.39.0
* PhantomJS 1.9.2
* Requests 0.13.5
* Watchdog 0.6.0 (optional)

## Getting started

### Simple download
1. Open auto-bill.cfg in an editor of your choice, supply your username and password credentials. Save the file.
2. Run python auto_bill.py 

### Perform an action once the file has been downloaded
1. Open auto-bill.cfg in an editor of your choice, supply your username and password credentials. 
2. Specify the shell script to run when a new file has been created using the file-script option.
3. Save the file.
4. Run ./auto_bill_monitor.py in a background shell instance.

Needless to say, if you're inserting your credentials into a plaintext file be sure to set the permissions up correctly so that only you have access to the configuration file.

Enjoy :)
